# t2t-variants

## Primary analysis
- [1000genomes_metadata](1000genomes_metadata): how/where to download metadata for 1000 genomes samples
- [figures](figure): individual panels from Figure 2 and related supplemental figures
- [population-variant-stats-per-sample](population-variant-stats-per-sample/): count of variants per sample across population/superpopulation as plotted in Figure 2 and related Supplemental Figures
- 
- [wdls](wdls): Workflows for processing the 1000 genomes samples in [AnVIL](http://anvilproject.org)


## Exploratory analysis
- [chromosome_repeats](chromosome_repeats): make plots of uniqueness/repetitiveness of each chromosome
- [chromosome_variants](chromosome_variants): make plots of variants per chromosome
- [local_ancestry](local_ancestry): make plots of number of variants in regions with different local ancestries
- [novel_region_af](novel_region_af): Allele frequency in novel regions (previously unresolved in GRCh38)
- [novel_regions](novel_regions): Notes on novel regions of T2T-CHM13 (previously unresolved by GRCh38)
- [population-variant-stats](population-variant-stats): Summary of variants per population
- [samtools_stats_chm13](samtools_stats_chm13): summary plots of mapping rates by population/superpopulation for 1000 genomes samples
