I think what you’re looking for is here: `/data/Phillippy/t2t-share/team-genes/bed_tracks/`

the `chm13_v1.0_lifted.issues.bed` has info on grch38 issues with those in red as unresolved and black as resolved in a grch38 patch or grch39

as for regions not in grch38, i’ve been relying on mitchell’s/mark’s synteny info: `/team-segdups/Assembly_analysis/snyteny/chm13.draft_v1.0_plus38Y.no_snyteny_1Mbp.bed`
